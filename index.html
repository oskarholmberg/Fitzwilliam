<p> This project is brought to you by students from Lund University Institute of Technology, Astri Magnussen, Axel Friberg, Erik Munkby and Oskar Holmberg</p>

<p>In a not too far distant future where access to natural resources has grown scarce, humanity is forced to take drastic actions to ensure their own survival. As a last effort a clone is made of the legendary gentleman Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy (also known from Pride and Prejudice). His mission, travel through alternate universes in search of a new place to settle. However, as the theory of infinite universes tells us, he is unlikely to be alone. Civilizations from other parallel universes have had the same idea. Thus begins the clash of Fitzwilliams! Help him out to make sure that your universe is the one to survive!  </p>

<p>Fitzwilliam is a multiplayer (maximum of 4 players recommended) online arena style shooter where the main objective
is to eliminate your opponent. To help you accomplish this goal you have a
jetpack, a laser gun and grenades that ricochet.</p>

<p>Fitzwilliam is built using the Java game development framework
<a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com">Libgdx</a> which has the benefit of being
cross-platform. The game uses Java's DatagramSockets to send the network data
via UDP. This ensures a low latency gaming experience. A peer to
peer architecture is used where one of the players at the start of the game
decides that he/she wants to host the session. This means that you don't have to
find a dedicated server to run the game.</p>

<p>Being a group of gamers ourselves it was fun to try out developing our own game
for the first time. We had previous experience with Java so the net code was
quite easy and straight forward to implement. Especially since the actual
messages that are sent are quite simple (jump, shoot, move etc.). Having not
much previous experience with game development and more specifically Libgdx this
took quite a lot of time. This was however a fun learning experience and once
you got a hang of how Libgdx worked it was quite easy to work with if you have
previous experience with Java.</p>
