As a last effort a clone is made of the legendary gentleman Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy (also known from Pride and Prejudice). His mission, travel through alternate universes in search of a new place to settle. However, as the theory of infinite universes tells us, he is not the only one. Civilizations from other parallel universes have had the same idea. Thus begins the clash of Fitzwilliams! Help him out to make sure that your universe is the one to survive!  \r\n\r\nFitzwilliam is a two player online arena style shooter where the main objective\r\nis to eliminate your opponent. To help you accomplish this goal you have a\r\njetpack, a laser gun and grenades that ricochet.\r\n\r\n![Fitzwilliam in action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4318639/15375200/2217a424-1d4e-11e6-842c-bbf35e2e35ff.png)\r\n\r\n# Built to be online\r\nFitzwilliam is build using the Java game development framework\r\n[Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) which has the benefit of being\r\ncross-platform. The game uses Java's DatagramSockets to send the network data\r\nvia UDP. This ensures a low latency gaming experience. A peer to\r\npeer architecture is used where one of the players at the start of the game\r\ndecides that he/she wants to host the session. This means that you don't have to\r\nfind a dedicated server to run the game.\r\n\r\n# Our experiences developing the game\r\nBeing a group of gamers ourselves it was fun to try out developing our own game\r\nfor the first time. We had previous experience with Java so the net code was\r\nquite easy and straight forward to implement. Especially since the actual\r\nmessages that are sent are quite simple (jump, shoot, move etc.). Having not\r\nmuch previous experience with game development and more specifically Libgdx this\r\ntook quite a lot of time. This was however a fun learning experience and once\r\nyou got a hang of how Libgdx worked it was quite easy to work with if you have\r\nprevious experience with Java.\r\n",
